*******************
Headphone indicator
*******************
Android app that shows a notification icon in the status bar when
headphones are plugged into the phone.

The app aims to be a tiny as possible.

Runs on Android 4.4+.


=====
Usage
=====
After installation_, you have to start the application `at least once`__.
Then it will be running as a background service that shows the headset
status icon whenever the headphones are plugged in.

You can close the app, and the status icon will still work - even after
rebooting your phone.

===================
Why was it written?
===================
I wrote the headphone indicator app because I was immensely unsatisfied
with apps like `susomena's Headphones Indicator`__ which are over
2 MiB in size, but 99% of their code is only related to advertisement.

My task was to show that you can make it much, much better.

============
Installation
============
You have several installation options:

#. Install from `F-Droid`__
#. Pay on `Google Play`__
#. Download ``.apk`` from `Github`__
#. `Build it yourself <#building>`_

========
Building
========
::

    $ gradle build

Note that AndroidStudio 1.5.1 does not detect the gradle configuration correctly
and produces ``.apk`` files much larger than necessary, with duplicated files.

``gradle`` on command line does it correctly, though.


Releasing
=========
Build it normally, then sign the generated package file::

    $ gradle assembleRelease

To sign the release with your key, put the path to the signing configuration
file into ``gradle.properties``::

    signingconfigfile=/path/to/signing-config.gradle

The signing configuration file should look like shown in
`Handling signing configs with Gradle`__

Dependencies
============
* gradle 8.5.2 (earlier will probably work, too)
* Android SDK 34 (compiles for SDK 19 - Android 4.4)
