Shows a notification icon in the status bar when headphones are plugged into the phone.

Shows a different icon when a headset is attached.
Both 3.5mm audio jack devices and USB headphones/headsets are supported.

The app aims to be a tiny as possible. No ads, no analytics - just its core functionality.

After installation, you have to start the application at least once. Then it will be running as a background service that shows the headset status icon whenever the headphones are plugged in.

I wrote the headphone indicator app because I was immensely unsatisfied with apps like (google forced me to remove the name) which are over 2 MiB in size, but 99% of their code is only related to advertisement.
